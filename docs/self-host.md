# Self-hosting Disco

This is the supported one-command path for a local Linux or WSL2 host. Sandboxes
use the current user's rootless Podman service by default: no root-owned container
socket is inherited by a fresh install.

## Quickstart

This is the supported self-host path from a clean checkout. It boots the app,
agent, frontend, data volume, bundled encoders, and bundled TTS without source
edits or a required `.env` file:

### Prerequisites

`git`, rootless **Podman**, and a compose provider. Nothing else — no Python, no
Node, no `uv` on the host; nothing is built. The stack pulls the published
images from GHCR (amd64 and arm64; about 5 GB the first time, most of it the
server image's bundled encoder and TTS weights). `DISCO_IMAGE_TAG` selects a
release; the default is the tag the checkout was cut from.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git podman docker-compose   # Debian 13
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git podman podman-compose   # Ubuntu 24.04
```

Those two are the combinations this project installs and tests on. On any other
distribution install `git`, `podman`, and a compose provider — prefer **Compose
v2** (usually packaged as `docker-compose`), and fall back to `podman-compose`
where Compose v2 is not packaged or is still the retired Python v1, which is the
case on Ubuntu 24.04.

`podman compose` is a thin wrapper that hands the file to whichever provider it
finds, and the providers are not equivalent. Installing `docker-compose` does
not install a Docker daemon and does not change which engine runs the
containers.

If your provider is `podman-compose` 1.3.x, `podman compose up` fails with

```
Error: invalid port format - format is [[hostIP:]hostPort:]containerPort
```

and, more quietly, hands the containers environment values that still read
`${DISCO_ENCODER_TIER:-full}`. That version does not apply a `${VAR:-default}`
when `VAR` is unset and is also one of the service's own environment keys.
Install `docker-compose` and run `podman compose up -d` again.

**Rootless Podman** (the path this project's install testing actually covers):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dyluhn/disco.git
cd disco
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start dbus.socket
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
export DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock
podman compose up -d
podman compose logs app-server
```

The two `systemctl --user` lines before `enable-linger` set up the per-user
services the Podman install just added. Logging out and back in does the same
thing. Skipping them is the usual cause of

```
error running container: from /usr/bin/crun creating container for [...]:
  sd-bus call: Interactive authentication required.: Permission denied
```

part-way through the image build — rootless `crun` needs your user's D-Bus, and
a shell that was already open when Podman was installed does not have it. (On
Debian 13 a *fresh* login does not have it either until the socket is started
once.) `enable-linger` then keeps the stack running after you disconnect.

The `export` points the Build sandbox at *your* rootless Podman socket. The
compose file is written for the compose providers distributions actually ship,
which substitute variables in a single pass — so its own fallback can only spell
the literal uid-1000 path, not `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Exporting it is correct at any
uid. Keep it exported for every later `podman compose` command in the same shell
(`logs`, `exec`, `down`).

**Rootless Docker** — do NOT run the Podman lines above; `podman.socket` does not
exist on a Docker host and the enable step fails. Rootless Docker is not a
distribution package on Ubuntu; it comes from Docker's own installer, and the
`apt` line below is only the CLI, the compose plugin and the user-namespace
tools it needs:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  git curl uidmap dbus-user-session docker-compose-v2
sudo systemctl disable --now docker.service docker.socket   # the rootful daemon apt pulled in
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user start dbus.socket
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/rootless | sh
```

On Ubuntu 23.10 and later that last command stops with

```
[rootlesskit:parent] error: failed to start the child: fork/exec /proc/self/exe: permission denied
[ERROR] RootlessKit failed, see the error messages and https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/
```

because Ubuntu restricts unprivileged user namespaces. The binaries are already
in place at that point; grant `rootlesskit` the exception and finish:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apparmor.d/home."$USER".bin.rootlesskit >/dev/null <<EOF
abi <abi/4.0>,
include <tunables/global>
$HOME/bin/rootlesskit flags=(unconfined) {
  userns,
}
EOF
sudo systemctl restart apparmor.service
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
```

Then point this shell at the rootless daemon and bring the stack up:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock"
git clone https://github.com/Dyluhn/disco.git
cd disco
DISCO_LOCAL_ENGINE=docker DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock \
  docker compose up -d
docker compose logs app-server
```

Keep both exports set for every later `docker compose` command in this shell, or
add them to `~/.bashrc` as the installer suggests.

Confirm the services before going further — a compose provider can report
success while one image failed to pull or start. Check with `podman ps`, not
`compose ps`: the two compose providers print different things, and only one of them
prints health at all.

```bash
podman ps --format '{{.Names}} {{.Status}}'     # or: docker ps --format ...
```

Expect three running containers — `app-server`, `agent-server` and `frontend` —
each **Up ... (healthy)**. The names are `disco_app-server_1` under
podman-compose and `disco-app-server-1` under Compose v2.

A fourth container, `sandbox-image`, is expected to be **Exited (0)**; it pulls
the published sandbox image into your daemon, tags it `disco-sandbox:base` (the
name the Settings default expects), and stops. Add `-a` to `podman ps` to see it.

What `podman compose ps` shows instead, and why it is not the check: under
podman-compose it lists all four containers with health, but under the
Compose v2 (`docker-compose`) provider — the one Debian 13 uses — it lists three
rows, hides the exited `sandbox-image`, and never prints `(healthy)` even when
every healthcheck is passing.

Then open **http://localhost:8088** in a browser.

One thing Docker prints that looks like a failure and is not, when building from
a checkout (`compose.build.yaml`): if the build dies within about 20 seconds on
a `dns error` reaching a package index, that is rootless Docker's network
namespace failing to reach systemd-resolved's loopback stub, not a problem with
disco; give the daemon explicit resolvers:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/docker
echo '{"dns":["1.1.1.1","8.8.8.8"]}' > ~/.config/docker/daemon.json
systemctl --user restart docker
```

The app-server logs print the working UI URL and the admin pairing token. A
browser on the same machine pairs itself and never asks for it. If it does ask —
you are opening the UI from another machine, or you cleared the cookie — print
the token on demand:

```bash
podman compose exec app-server python -m disco.app_server.pairing_cli
```

It is derived from this install's secret rather than minted per boot, so that
command prints the same token every time. To find it in the boot log instead,
grep for the banner — `logs | tail` will not do, healthcheck lines push the
banner out of the last twenty lines within minutes:

```bash
podman compose logs app-server | grep -A 8 "Disco self-host boot"
```

Configure a driver model after boot in **Settings -> Models & Providers**, then
prove the configuration:

```bash
podman compose exec agent-server disco-verify --quick
```

### Configuring the driver model without a browser

A headless server has no Settings page. The app-server API on port 8800 does the
same three things the Settings screen does. Adding a *provider* is the whole
job: it stores the key encrypted and approves the endpoint's origin for egress
in one call. (Storing a bare secret and hand-writing a model entry does not
work — a model whose `api_key_env` names a plain environment variable has that
reference quarantined, and the request then goes out unauthenticated.)

```bash
# Pair once. On a loopback-bound install (the default) no token is needed.
CSRF=$(curl -s -c /tmp/disco.jar -H 'Origin: http://127.0.0.1:8800' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' \
        http://127.0.0.1:8800/api/auth/mint | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["csrf_token"])')
AUTH=(-b /tmp/disco.jar -H "Origin: http://127.0.0.1:8800" -H "X-Disco-CSRF: $CSRF" -H 'Content-Type: application/json')

# 1. the provider — label, OpenAI-compatible base URL, and the key.
curl -s "${AUTH[@]}" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8800/api/providers -d "{
  \"label\": \"My Provider\", \"base_url\": \"https://example.com/v1\",
  \"kind\": \"openai-compat\", \"api_key\": \"$YOUR_KEY\", \"requires_api_key\": true}"
# -> {"provider":{"id":"my-provider",...},"catalogue_ok":true}

# 2. see what it serves, and enable the one you want to drive the loop.
curl -s "${AUTH[@]}" http://127.0.0.1:8800/api/providers/my-provider/models
curl -s "${AUTH[@]}" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8800/api/providers/my-provider/enable \
  -d '{"model_id": "<served-model-id>", "context_window": 131072}'
# -> the catalogue, including "prov-my-provider-<served-model-id>"

# 3. make it the default driver.
curl -s "${AUTH[@]}" -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:8800/api/models/assignments \
  -d '{"default_model": "prov-my-provider-<served-model-id>"}'
```

`GET /api/providers/presets` lists ready-made base URLs (OpenRouter, OpenAI,
Anthropic, Groq, DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, Mistral, xAI). Pass the key in
the request body only — never on a command line that lands in shell history.

## Services

| Service | Default port | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `frontend` | 8088 | Nginx-served web UI with runtime `/env.js`. |
| `app-server` | 8800 | Settings, auth pairing, library API. |
| `agent-server` | 8000 | Conversation runtime, tools, retrieval, TTS. |
| `sandbox-image` | none | Build-only; builds by default so Build/Agent surfaces work out of the box. |

All durable application state lives in the `disco-data` volume. The default
server image already contains the fastembed ONNX models and Kokoro TTS weights
under `/opt/disco-cache`, so the `/data` volume does not hide them.

## Start at boot

A rootless compose project does not come back after a reboot on its own:
`restart: unless-stopped` covers a crash while the machine is up, not a cold
boot, because no system-wide service owns rootless containers. One user unit
owns the project. Save as `~/.config/systemd/user/disco.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Disco (compose project)
Wants=network-online.target podman.socket
After=network-online.target podman.socket

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
WorkingDirectory=%h/disco
Environment=DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=%t/podman/podman.sock
ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman compose up -d
ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman compose down
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now disco.service
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
```

`%h` is the home directory and `%t` is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so the unit is
uid-independent. On rootless Docker use `%h/bin/docker compose` in both Exec
lines with `Environment=DOCKER_HOST=unix://%t/docker.sock`. `enable-linger` is
what lets the unit run with nobody logged in — it is already in the Quickstart.
`podman generate systemd` is not the right tool here: it emits one unit per
container and is deprecated in Podman 5, and Quadlet has no compose equivalent.

## Backup and restore

Use the repository lifecycle command rather than copying a live `disco.db` file.
Backup briefly stops the front door and the two database writers, uses SQLite's
backup API, archives the complete `disco-data` volume with per-entry SHA-256
checksums, then restores the prior service state. The writers start first and the
front door is brought back through its healthy-backend dependencies, so a
Docker or rootless-Podman backend reattachment cannot leave nginx on a stale
network path:

```bash
.venv/bin/python development/scripts/self_host_data.py backup \
  --output "$HOME/disco-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"
```

The archive includes the consistent SQLite database, its sidecar settings files,
the generated `.secret_key`, encrypted `secrets.json`, origin approvals, projects,
skills, generated audio/assets, and every other regular entry under `/data`.
Transient SQLite `-wal`/`-shm` files are replaced by the consistent backup
database. Rebuildable image assets under `/opt/disco-cache` are deliberately not
included because they are baked into `disco-server`. Unsafe escaping symlinks and
special device/socket files make backup fail instead of being silently omitted.

Restore accepts only a checksummed v1 archive and only an empty `disco-data`
volume. It rejects traversal, unsafe links, duplicate members, checksum drift,
and a failed SQLite integrity check before promoting any restored entry:

```bash
.venv/bin/python development/scripts/self_host_data.py restore \
  --archive "$HOME/disco-backup-20260721.tar.gz"
```

If the named volume does not exist, restore creates it; if it exists and contains
anything, restore stops with no overwrite. After validation it starts the app,
agent, and frontend services. Use `--engine docker` when Docker Compose owns the
installation, and `--project-name NAME` if the original Compose project was not
the default `disco`.

## Rotate the encrypted Settings key

`DISCO_SECRET_KEY_ID` gives the active encryption key a non-secret identity.
`DISCO_SECRET_READ_KEYS` is a JSON object containing at most four prior key IDs
and their key material. Both server services receive the same bounded keyring;
never commit populated values or paste them into logs.

Take a backup first. Then stop the stack, put the new key and ID in `.env`, and
put the old key under its old ID in `DISCO_SECRET_READ_KEYS`. Existing unnamed
keys remain readable when you assign their material a name. Run the migration
through the image so it operates on the shared `/data/secrets.json` volume:

```bash
.venv/bin/python development/scripts/self_host_data.py backup \
  --output "$HOME/disco-before-key-rotation-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"
podman compose down
# Edit .env: DISCO_SECRET_KEY, DISCO_SECRET_KEY_ID, DISCO_SECRET_READ_KEYS
podman compose run --rm --no-deps app-server \
  python /app/scripts/rotate_secret_store.py --path /data/secrets.json migrate
podman compose run --rm --no-deps app-server \
  python /app/scripts/rotate_secret_store.py --path /data/secrets.json verify
podman compose up -d
podman compose exec agent-server disco-verify --quick
```

Migration is one atomic file replacement and retains encrypted rollback records
in that same file. If the process is interrupted, rerun `migrate` or use the
equivalent `resume` action; both verify an already-written pending migration and
continue safely. Once both services and stored provider keys work, finalize the
window, remove `DISCO_SECRET_READ_KEYS` from `.env`, and recreate both servers so
the retired material leaves their environments:

```bash
podman compose exec app-server \
  python /app/scripts/rotate_secret_store.py --path /data/secrets.json finalize
podman compose up -d --force-recreate app-server agent-server
```

Before finalization, rollback is available. Stop the stack, restore the old key
as `DISCO_SECRET_KEY`/`DISCO_SECRET_KEY_ID`, place the new key in the bounded read
map, then run the script's `rollback` action and restart. A missing named key,
malformed state, failed ciphertext authentication, or incomplete rollback window
fails loudly; the command never prints key material, ciphertext, or secret names.

## Upgrade and uninstall

Upgrade is backup-first, then pulls the release's images and starts the stack:

```bash
.venv/bin/python development/scripts/self_host_data.py upgrade \
  --backup "$HOME/disco-pre-upgrade-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz"
podman compose logs app-server agent-server
podman compose exec agent-server disco-verify --quick
```

Without the lifecycle script the update is:

```bash
git pull                        # or: git checkout v0.2.0 — the tag pins DISCO_IMAGE_TAG
podman compose down             # or: docker compose down
podman compose pull
podman compose up -d
```

The `down` is required, and `upgrade` runs the same `down` internally for the
same reason: podman-compose 1.0.6 (Ubuntu 24.04) cannot replace a running
container on `up` — it fails with `the container name "disco_frontend_1" is
already in use` (exit 125) and restarts the old container, so the operator
keeps running the old images. `down` removes containers only; `disco-data`
survives. `down --volumes` deletes it.

Application rollback is a source/image operation. Once a newer version has
written a schema an older version may not understand, in-place rollback is not
supported; restore the pre-upgrade archive into a new empty volume with the old
source/image instead.

Ordinary uninstall removes containers and the project network but retains and
reports the exact named `disco-data` volume:

```bash
.venv/bin/python development/scripts/self_host_data.py uninstall
```

Deleting durable data is a separate, explicit operation. It reports the volume
it removed and refuses any confirmation other than the exact phrase below:

```bash
.venv/bin/python development/scripts/self_host_data.py uninstall \
  --destroy-data --confirm DELETE_DISCO_DATA
```

### Scaling and preview redemption

The supported Compose topology runs one `agent-server` against the single
`/data/disco.db` SQLite database in `disco-data`. Do not horizontally scale
preview-serving processes onto independent database files while they share a
`DISCO_SECRET_KEY`: preview launch intents are one-time credentials, and their
atomic redemption fence is the transaction in that shared database.

The preview credential's redemption transaction is cross-process-safe when every
redeemer uses that same SQLite database on a filesystem with correct SQLite
locking semantics. This narrow guarantee does **not** make the complete Agent
runtime multi-worker-safe: loop ownership, schedules, and several runtime caches
are process-local. Run exactly one `agent-server` worker per database. A future
multi-worker Agent runtime would additionally need durable conversation-run and
schedule leases; copying or replicating the database is unsupported.

### Remote preview cookie boundary

For an Internet-facing deployment, route wildcard DNS and TLS for a separately
registrable preview site to the same frontend/agent-server ingress, then set:

```bash
DISCO_PUBLIC_UI_URL=https://app.example.com
DISCO_PREVIEW_ORIGIN_BASE=https://preview.example.net
```

The preview origin must not be a child, parent, or sibling site of the UI. For
example, `preview.example.com` is **not** isolated from `app.example.com`: code
on the preview child can still set `Domain=example.com` cookies and exhaust the
parent cookie jar or request-header budget. Disco conservatively rejects a
configured preview base that shares its final two DNS labels with the request
host or `DISCO_PUBLIC_UI_URL`; the public UI URL is required whenever this
override is set. Unicode and punycode spellings are canonicalized before this
comparison. The configured preview base must use HTTPS, a valid nonzero port if
one is explicit, and a DNS name that leaves room for the generated preview
label. The wildcard (`*.preview.example.net` in this example) must terminate TLS
and forward the original `Host` header to the standard front door.

Signature validation prevents a tossed cookie from becoming authenticated, but
it cannot prevent browser cookie eviction or oversized-header denial of service.
The separate registrable site is therefore the supported remote availability
boundary. Localhost deployments can leave this setting blank.

## Sandbox Image

The default boot pulls the published sandbox image
(`ghcr.io/dyluhn/disco-sandbox:<tag>`) and tags it `disco-sandbox:base` in your
daemon, so the Build and Agent surfaces work out of the box. For a lean stack
without build capability, comment out the `sandbox-image` service in
`compose.yaml`.

The agent-server mounts the current user's rootless Podman socket by default. On
Linux and WSL2 with systemd, enable it once before bringing up the stack:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start dbus.socket
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
export DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock
podman compose up -d
```

The first two lines start the per-user services the Podman install added;
without the user D-Bus, rootless `crun` fails to start containers with `sd-bus
call: Interactive authentication required`. Logging out and back in is equivalent.
`enable-linger` keeps the containers running after the operator disconnects.

Export the socket rather than relying on the compose default. `compose.yaml` is
written for the compose providers distributions ship, which substitute variables
in a single pass and so cannot expand a nested `${A:-${B}}` — the fallback baked
into the file can therefore only spell the literal
`/run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock`, which is wrong for any UID but 1000. Keep
`DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET` exported for every later `podman compose` command in the
same shell. `DISCO_LOCAL_ENGINE=podman` is the default and
keeps native Podman lifecycle/exec semantics even though the socket has the
engine-neutral in-container name `/var/run/docker.sock`.

Docker is also supported, and rootless Docker is the preferred way to run it: it
keeps the same non-root-owned boundary as the Podman default. Its socket lives
under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, not `/var/run`:

```bash
DISCO_LOCAL_ENGINE=docker DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock \
  docker compose up -d
```

Rootful Docker's socket at `/var/run/docker.sock` grants root-equivalent control
of the host. It is not selected automatically. A trusted single-user operator can
explicitly accept that weaker host boundary (the `sandbox-image` service pulls
the sandbox image into that daemon):

```bash
DISCO_LOCAL_ENGINE=docker DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker compose up -d
```

gVisor is an optional stronger tier, but **not on the rootless-Podman default
path.** Podman's Docker-compatible API silently drops the requested runtime when
creating a container, so asking for `runsc` there produced an ordinary `crun`
container with no isolation upgrade and no error. The sandbox now inspects the
runtime it actually received and refuses to run when it does not match the one
requested — you get a typed failure instead of a boundary you only believed in.
That check runs on **every** container backend, not just Podman: pointing
`DISCO_LOCAL_ENGINE=docker` at what is in fact Podman's Docker-compatible socket
reaches the same daemon, and that socket's `/info` advertises `runsc` from a
static candidate path whether or not the binary is installed — so a pre-flight
"is the runtime registered?" check cannot tell the truth there. The same
after-the-fact inspection also confirms the memory/CPU/pids caps were recorded,
and refuses to start a container that came back without them.

For a real gVisor boundary, install `runsc` per
[gVisor's instructions](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/install/) and use
**rootful Docker**, which honours the runtime:

```bash
DISCO_LOCAL_ENGINE=docker DISCO_SANDBOX_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock \
  DISCO_LOCAL_RUNTIME=runsc docker compose up -d
```

Note that `/var/run/docker.sock` is root-equivalent, so this trades one boundary
for another; the remote `gvisor` backend avoids that trade. Also be aware that
`runsc` under a rootless engine currently fails on cgroup delegation
(`/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control: permission denied`), and the
`--runtime-flag ignore-cgroups` workaround disables the memory/CPU/pids limits
this project treats as essential. That posture is invisible to the container
inspection above — the caps are recorded and simply never enforced — so the
sandbox instead reads the runtime's registered arguments and logs a loud
`sandbox.cgroup_enforcement_disabled` error when it finds the flag. It is a
warning rather than a refusal because this guide documents the workaround; if you
are running it, agent code can exhaust host memory, CPU and PIDs.

The unisolated `process` backend is development-only and fails closed unless both
`DISCO_SANDBOX=process` and `DISCO_ALLOW_PROCESS_SANDBOX_FOR_DEV=1` are explicit.

## Models

Disco needs a driver LLM that can speak the OpenAI chat-completions API and emit
tool calls. Good options are Ollama, llama.cpp server, vLLM, LM Studio, or a paid
OpenAI-compatible vendor. Configure the endpoint and key in Settings, not by
editing source files.

The non-generative defaults are keyless:

| Capability | Default |
|---|---|
| Search | `ddgs` |
| Extraction | local fetch/readability |
| Embeddings | fastembed ONNX, `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` |
| Rerank/NLI | fastembed ONNX, `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` |
| TTS | bundled Kokoro ONNX, voices `af_heart` and `af_bella` |

### Reaching a service running on the host machine

An endpoint on the host — Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, a local MCP server —
is **not** at `localhost` from inside the containers, and the address that does
work depends on which engine you run. Measured on this project's own hosts,
2026-08-21:

| Engine | `host.docker.internal` | Host's LAN IP |
|---|---|---|
| rootless Podman (the documented default) | **works** — resolves to `169.254.1.2`, host ports reachable | **fails** — pasta gives the container the host's own address, so this loops back to the container |
| rootless Docker | **fails** — resolves to `172.17.0.1`, every port refused | **works** — use `192.168.x.y` etc. |
| rootful Docker / Docker Desktop | works (`host-gateway`) | works |

Evidence for the rootless-Docker row: with `sshd` listening on `0.0.0.0:22` on
the host, a socket from inside `agent-server` to `172.17.0.1:22` (and to the
compose network gateway `172.21.0.1:22`) is refused, while `<host-LAN-IP>:22`
connects. Rootless Docker's network namespace has no route back to host
listeners, so the `host-gateway` alias Compose sets is a dead address there.

The `Ollama (local)` provider preset ships `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`
because rootless Podman is the documented default. **On rootless Docker, replace
that host with your machine's LAN IP** (`hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`) and
make sure the service binds `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`. The same substitution
applies to any MCP server URL pointing at the host.

The published image bakes the full encoder tier. A smaller server image can be
built from a checkout with the build override:

```bash
DISCO_ENCODER_TIER=lite podman compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --build
```

## Providers

Disco has keyless defaults for retrieval and local artifact services. The driver
LLM is intentionally not bundled; point it at a model endpoint you run or a paid
OpenAI-compatible API.

| Capability | Keyless default | Self-host option | Paid/BYO-key option |
|---|---|---|---|
| Driver LLM | OpenAI-compatible local endpoint, if you run one | Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint configured in Settings |
| Search | DuckDuckGo via `ddgs` | SearXNG | Tavily or Brave |
| Extraction | Local HTTP fetch/readability | Crawl4AI | Firecrawl |
| Embeddings/rerank/NLI | Bundled ONNX CPU encoders | Remote encoder/NLI endpoints | OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoints where configured |
| TTS | Bundled Kokoro ONNX | Speaches/OpenAI-compatible TTS | OpenAI-compatible TTS |
| Image generation | None bundled | ComfyUI | OpenAI-compatible image API or OpenRouter |

Provider keys are read from encrypted Settings secrets first, then matching
environment variables such as `DISCO_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`,
`BRAVE_API_KEY`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Hardware

- **Basic research/dev:** 8 GB RAM is workable with `DISCO_ENCODER_TIER=lite`.
  The lite encoder tier downloads about 0.15 GB of ONNX models.
- **Full local retrieval quality:** use `DISCO_ENCODER_TIER=full` on a box with
  at least 16 GB RAM; the full encoder tier is roughly 4 GB of model weights.
- **Useful local agent driver:** use a 24-32B-class instruction model with a
  32k+ context window, served by Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, or a LAN
  endpoint. Smaller CPU-only models are suitable only for smoke tests.
- **Build isolation:** Docker or rootless Podman is recommended for real Build
  runs. The `process` sandbox is a convenience for local development only.
- **Windows:** use WSL2 or Docker.

## MCP servers

Both MCP transports are served by the `agent-server` container. Add servers in
**Settings -> MCP**; each one passes two approvals (the config/origin approval,
then a tool-schema approval) before any tool becomes callable.

**Example — DeepGit, GitHub repository research (stdio).** In **Settings -> MCP**
add a stdio server with command `uvx` and arguments
`--from git+https://github.com/zamalali/DeepGit@206f634acd7b3d28603caf4b8cfb27418bdc0a61 deepgit-mcp`,
and set `GITHUB_API_KEY` (public-repo read), `LLM_PROVIDER` (`groq`, `openai`,
`anthropic` or `vertex_ai`) and that provider's key in the server's environment.
The agent-server image must be able to run `uvx` and reach GitHub; the tools it
gains are `find_repositories`, `find_repositories_json` and `deep_research`. The
same server is registered for Claude Code sessions in `.mcp.json`.

**Remote (`streamable_http`).** The URL must be reachable *from the agent-server
container* — see [Reaching a service running on the host
machine](#reaching-a-service-running-on-the-host-machine) if the server runs on
your own machine. Under the default `DISCO_BUILD_EGRESS=filtered` posture the
orchestrator's MCP HTTP client connects directly once the origin is approved.
It does **not** route through an egress proxy, because the shipped stack runs
none: the allowlisting proxy is created per-sandbox with a per-run allowlist by
the sandbox backends, and a static orchestrator-side one could not track an
allowlist that changes whenever Settings changes. An unapproved origin is
refused before a client is ever constructed, so the approval gate — not the
proxy — is what bounds where the orchestrator can connect. Operators who do run
their own outbound proxy can force approved MCP origins back through it with
`DISCO_MCP_EGRESS_PROXY_REQUIRED=1` (default `0`); it must then be listening on
`DISCO_MCP_EGRESS_PROXY_HOST:8888` from inside the container.

**Local (`stdio`).** The server image ships Node 22 plus `npm`/`npx`, so the
usual `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-...` command lines work out of the
box. The subprocess runs **inside the agent-server container**, not in a
sandbox: it gets only `PATH`, `HOME`, locale, `TMPDIR` and the secret refs you
explicitly attach — never `DISCO_SECRET_KEY` or provider keys — but it does run
with the agent-server's filesystem access (including `/data`) and network.

> **Security tradeoff, stated plainly.** Approving a stdio MCP server lets `npx`
> download and execute an arbitrary npm package, with its transitive
> dependencies, inside the agent-server container. That is the cost of stdio MCP
> support at all; the approval gate is the control. Pin versions
> (`@scope/pkg@1.2.3`) rather than floating tags, and prefer a remote
> `streamable_http` server when one exists. If you do not want this, do not
> approve stdio servers — the runtime being present does not launch anything on
> its own.

## Reference packs

A Reference Pack is a reusable collection of your own files — a brand kit, a
product spec, a data sample, a style guide — that a Build can select. Packs
are inert user data: they never grant tools, network access or policy, and
instruction-like text inside them is reference material, not instructions.

- **Create one from an Agent task.** Attach the files (or have the Agent
  produce them), then ask: "make a reference pack called Brand kit from these
  files". The Agent's `create_reference_pack` action copies the exact bytes into
  your library. Uploading a file never creates a pack by itself.
- **Manage under Settings → Extensions & Storage → Reference packs.** Rename,
  describe, add or replace files, remove a file, delete. Each file shows a
  truthful state: `Ready` (the agent can read it as text; text PDFs included),
  `Asset only` (pixels, or a PDF with no extractable text), or `Couldn't read`.
- **Select packs in Build.** In the Build options row, **References** is a
  multi-select over your library. Only packs you pick enter that build. They are
  bound before the first model call: the server copies the exact bytes into
  conversation-owned storage, so editing or deleting the library pack afterwards
  changes future builds only; a running or resumed build keeps its snapshot.
- **What the agent gets.** Each selected pack lands in the workspace as
  `references/<pack>/PACK.md` (the index: files, types, sizes, states) plus the
  original files and a `<file>.txt` companion for text PDFs (with page markers).
  The context names those indexes as required reading; a plan proposed before
  they were read is turned back into reading (at most twice). `reference_inspect`
  answers a question about an image through the configured vision route, or
  about one page of a PDF; with no vision route an image stays `Asset only`.

Storage: the library lives under the projects root
(`<projects_root>/reference-packs/<pack>/manifest.json` + `files/`), the
per-build snapshots next to the database (`disco.db.refpacks/<conversation>/`).
Both are ordinary files; include them in backups. Bounds: 50 files, 25 MB per
file, 200 MB per pack, 8 packs per build.

## Compose environment overrides

Compose passes an override only to the service that consumes it. Blank remote
encoder URLs keep the bundled local encoder tier; setting them has an effect when
`DISCO_ENCODERS=remote` (or the equivalent Settings mode) is selected.

| Override | Effective service | Omitted/default behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `DISCO_BUILD_EGRESS` | `agent-server` | `filtered`; registry allowlist proxy |
| `DISCO_MCP_EGRESS_PROXY_REQUIRED` | `agent-server` | `0`; approved MCP origins connect directly |
| `DISCO_MCP_EGRESS_PROXY_HOST` | `agent-server` | `127.0.0.1`; only read when the above is `1` |
| `DISCO_DRIVER_VISION` | `agent-server` | `0`; no driver-local vision claim |
| `DISCO_EMBEDDER_URL` | `agent-server` | blank; bundled embedder |
| `DISCO_RERANKER_URL` | `agent-server` | blank; bundled reranker |
| `DISCO_NLI_URL` | `agent-server` | blank; bundled NLI verifier |
| `DISCO_INSPECT` | `agent-server` | `0`; debug trace routes inert |
| `DISCO_LOG_LEVEL` / `DISCO_LOG_JSON` | both Python servers | `INFO` / `0` |
| `DISCO_BUILD_TAG` / `DISCO_BUILD_COMMIT` | build argument for the server image | `unknown`; the release workflow sets the tag and commit, shown by `/health` and the doctor |
| provider/search/image/TTS key variables from `.env.example` | both Python servers | blank; imported only after the matching origin is approved |

`DISCO_BUILD_EGRESS` accepts `filtered`, `public`, `sealed`, `open`, or `raw`;
unknown values fail closed. `open` and `raw` are explicit weaker postures. The
`DISCO_*` names take precedence, while the documented legacy `PMX_*` aliases
remain accepted by Compose where one exists.

## When something is wrong

Start with [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](./troubleshooting.md): one command inside the
agent-server container prints a PASS/FAIL table for the build, both servers, the
sandbox, the data disk, the database, the secret key and the driver model, and can
write the redacted support bundle a bug report asks for.

## Offline Asset Smoke

This proves the baked encoder and TTS assets are used with networking disabled:

```bash
podman run --rm --network none ghcr.io/dyluhn/disco-server:v0.2.0 \
  python /app/development/scripts/offline_asset_smoke.py
```

Expected output includes `offline assets ok` plus the embedding dimension,
reranked passage id, and TTS sample count.

## Building from source

`compose.build.yaml` adds `build:` blocks under the published image names, so
the rest of `compose.yaml` — including the `sandbox-image` tagging step — is
unchanged:

```bash
podman compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --build
```

Plain image builds, without compose:

```bash
podman build -t ghcr.io/dyluhn/disco-server:v0.2.0 -f deploy/compose/Dockerfile.server .
podman build -t ghcr.io/dyluhn/disco-frontend:v0.2.0 -f frontend/Dockerfile .
podman build -t ghcr.io/dyluhn/disco-sandbox:v0.2.0 -f deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile .
```

The published images are built by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on a tag
push, one native runner per architecture, after every gate has passed.

## Podman Notes

This host used Podman 5.8.2 for packaging verification. If `podman compose` has
no compose provider installed, use `podman-compose` or Docker Compose for the
compose-specific checks.

## Image Sizes

Measured during the packaging verification on 2026-07-07, under Podman 5.8.2:

| Image | Podman | Docker (BuildKit) |
|---|---:|---:|
| `disco-server` | 4.69 GB | 7.88 GB |
| `disco-frontend` | 65.4 MB | — |
| `disco-sandbox:base` | 2.95 GB | 4.21 GB |

Docker's figures were measured on Ubuntu 24.04 with rootless Docker on
2026-08-17. BuildKit adds provenance/attestation layers that Podman's builder
does not, so size a Docker host off the right column — the gap is over 3 GB on
the server image alone.

The default `disco-server` is expected to be large because it includes
LibreOffice plus the full fastembed and Kokoro asset set. Anything materially
above the recorded values should be investigated.

Since 2026-08-21 the server image also carries Node 22 + npm for stdio MCP
servers, copied from `node:22-bookworm-slim` rather than apt-installed. Measured
in isolation on `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` that layer adds about **140 MB**
(a 127 MB base became 267 MB) — roughly 3% of the server image.
